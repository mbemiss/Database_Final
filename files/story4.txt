Here's a short story of about a page in length for the title "Shattered Chronology":
Shattered Chronology
Agent Diaz blinked in disorientation as his surroundings abruptly changed. One moment he was trapped in the crumbling ruins, pinned by the amber energy discharge. The next, he was... elsewhere.
And elsewhen.
He stood in the middle of a suburban park, children playing on the swings and pedestrians strolling by without a care. But the casual scene bordered on the surreal - modern glass towers stretched into the skyline alongside ancient pyramids and turn-of-the-century factories belching smoke.
The temporal displacement had to be exponential this time. History's threads were frayed and realities intermingled chaotically.
A brilliant azure flash in the distance signaled the arrival point he needed. Diaz sprinted ahead, people flickering in and out of existence around him with each shifted moment.
He reached the stabilized chrono-zone just as the nexus opened. A shimmering rift tore through the fabric of space-time. On the other side awaited the twisted abomination that called itself Lord Entropy.
The paradox psychic force bent on erasing all of existence.
Diaz engaged his chronokinetic stabilizers and leapt through the portal. He tumbled across the fractured plane of the time-vortex, dodging shards of shattered pasts and futures that fractaled all around him.
There was Entropy, an amalgamation of multiple pasts and presents. With a roar of defiance, Diaz unleashed his chronon charges, firing directly into the splintered abomination's vortex.
Space and time shrieked in anguish, collapsing in on itself as Entropy's entropic forces clashed against Diaz's causality restoratives. For a single moment, the cosmos held its breath.
Then, with a cataclysmic implosion, chronology was remade.
